## 📥 Installation

### 1. Install a Userscript Manager Extension

You'll need a **userscript manager** to get started. I recommend **Violentmonkey** because it helps with **faster server region searching**.

If you're using **Chrome** and Violentmonkey is blocked, you can try **ScriptCat** instead. Just keep in mind that its **English translation isn't fully complete**.

**Heads up:** **Tampermonkey is *not recommended*** right now, since it has a bug that can slow down server region searching by up to *100×*.

### 2. Go to Greasyfork

Click the "Install from GreasyFork" button above. Note: GreasyFork is a trusted repository for userscripts.

### 3. Install the Script

On the GreasyFork page, click the install button. Confirm the action if your userscript manager shows a popup. Note: You can see the source code if you click the code tab on the top.

### 4. Visit Roblox

Go to Roblox.com and enjoy the free features!
